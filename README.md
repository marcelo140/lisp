# Yet Unnamed Lisp

This project is based on [kanaka/mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), a guide that leads you through the process of building a Clojure inspired Lisp interpreter. The guide is now complete and the implementation is capable of self-hosting.

My plan now is to continue improving and use it as a base to explore programming concepts that appeal to me. Some ideas that I would like to try out are:

- Compilation targetting LLVM or WebAssembly
- Continuation Passing Style
- Interoperability with Rust
- Actor model for concurrency

Also, by the end of the guide I was just trying to power through it, so some (read "a lot") refactoring is needed :c
